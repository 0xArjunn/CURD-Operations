# CURD-Operations
This project is a practice implementation of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). The goal of the project is to build a simple, functional application that demonstrates how to perform essential database operations through a user-friendly interface.

# Features
Create: Add new records (e.g., users, posts, or products).
Read: View a list of records or specific details of a record.
Update: Edit existing records.
Delete: Remove records from the system.

# Technologies Used in Your CRUD Project:

Backend:
Node.js – JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
Express.js – Web framework to handle routes and HTTP requests.

Frontend:
EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates) – For rendering dynamic HTML templates.

Database :
In-Memory Array or Object – We are storing posts in a temporary data structure (array), not using a full database yet.

HTTP Methods Used for CRUD Operations:
GET – To read and display posts.
POST – To create new posts.
PUT / PATCH – To update existing posts.
DELETE – To remove posts.
